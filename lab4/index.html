			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create pseudocode for a simple computer game. Put it in a javascript
						file as comments. Put the Java into this page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We sometimes had trouble deciding order and sub-steps. We weren't
						sure which tasks should go before others. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went well. We discussed each step and where to put them. It was 
						interesting to break down a process into many steps and sub-steps. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<pre><code>
							// pseudocode for Pac-Man

							// Print an empty maze
							// Set lives and scores to 0
								// Print this text on the screen
							// Loop that runs while he is still alive
								// Print the score and lives as text at the top
								// Print the current screen
								// Create the Pac-Man character that will be moved by the user
									// Take user input to move Pac-Man using coordinates
								// Create the ghosts that will move automatically
									// Algorithm to move them randomly (random coordinates)
									// When Pac-Man touches them, he loses a life
								// Print the dots in all paths that will be eaten by Pac-Man
									// They disappear as Pac-Man passes over them
									// Increase score 
								// Print the bigger powerup dots
									// They disappear as Pac-Man passes over them
									// He does not lose a life the next time he touches a ghost
							// Print game over message
