					<p>Hello, this is Caitlin! I am a second year CS major here at UCSC. I know a decent amount of 
						coding and am looking to learn more about ways I can use it to be creative. I have some HTML 
						experience, but from seventh grade. I love creativity in other parts of my life too. I am 
						into photography, especially film right now. I am excited for this class!</p>
					<p>My name is Alissa and it is my third year, I am a transfer student and my major is AGPM. 
						I am an artist and creative person. I believe that the combination of technology and art is 
						our future, and that is what I would like to do in my dream job. As an animator or digital art 
						designer. Moreover, I learned HTML and CSS in the community college.</p>
