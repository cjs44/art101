				test them locally, and publish to GitHub.</p>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The difficulties we encountered were when we tried to link images.
					In fact, it took a long time to wait for them to load on the webpage,
					and one of the images showed up as a question mark icon.
					We fixed this by being patient and also rereading our code to fix errors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>We learned that we should reread the instructions and double-check the names of our files,
					and make sure that we use lowercase and dashes instead of spaces.
					For example, we needed to change the format of the file from JPG to jpg.
					Also, we accidentally had an extra space at the beginning of the file’s name.</p>
